### 🖥 zsh

Using zsh from Homebrew with a custom .zshrc, which includes theme support with an async git status in the prompt and plugin support.  
Shell responsiveness has been achieved using [Zplugin](https://github.com/zdharma/zplugin) turbo mode to load plugins and loading custom functions in fpath. The shell loads in less than 0.04s.  
To view the functions included in fpath run ```funcs```
