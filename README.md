### 🖥 zsh

Using zsh from Homebrew with a custom .zshrc framework, including theme support with an async git status and plugin support.

The shell loads in 0.03s (0.2s with motd off/in a second tab or window).
Shell responsiveness is achieved using [Zplugin](https://github.com/zdharma/zplugin) turbo mode to load plugins and loading custom functions in fpath.

To view the functions included in fpath run ```funcs```
